How I would test the word count program is first by compiling and running the program. I would give several different inputs to test various types of inputs. Those inputs would be the following: no input, just newlines, just blanks, just tabs, combinations of only newlines, tabs, and blanks, one word per line, lines start with words, and lines starting with blanks, tabs, or both. This would cover all types of inputs that this program could be inputed into this program.
